`nycOpenData` provides simple, reproducible access to datasets from the  
[NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) platform — directly from R,  
with **no API keys** or manual downloads required. The package is available on 
**CRAN**.

Version **0.1.4** now includes wrappers for **30+ NYC Open Data APIs**, covering:

- 311 Service Requests  
- For-Hire Vehicles (FHV)  
- Juvenile Justice (rearrest rates + caseloads)  
- School Discharge Reporting  
- Violent & Disruptive School Incidents  
- Detention Admissions  
- Borough/Community District Reports  
- Street Tree Census  
- Urban Park Ranger Animal Condition Responses  
- Permitted Events (Historical)  
- and more  

All functions return clean **tibble** outputs and support filtering via  
`filters = list(field = "value")`.
