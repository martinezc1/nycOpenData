`nycOpenData` provides simple, reproducible access to datasets from the  
[NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) platform — directly from R,  
with **no API keys** or manual downloads required. The package is available on 
**CRAN**.

Version **0.1.5** now includes wrappers for **30+ NYC Open Data APIs**, covering:

- 311 Service Requests  
- For-Hire Vehicles (FHV)  
- Juvenile Justice (rearrest rates + caseloads)  
- School Discharge Reporting  
- Violent & Disruptive School Incidents  
- Detention Admissions  
- Borough/Community District Reports  
- Street Tree Census  
- Urban Park Ranger Animal Condition Responses  
- Permitted Events (Historical)  
- and more  

All functions return clean **tibble** outputs and support filtering via  
`filters = list(field = "value")`.

## Installation

### From **CRAN**

```r
install.packages("nycOpenData")
```

### Development version (GitHub)

```r
devtools::install_github("martinezc1/nycOpenData")
```

---

## Example

```{r}
library(nycOpenData)

# Get 5,000 most recent 311 requests
data <- nyc_311(limit = 5000)

# Filter by agency and city
filtered <- nyc_311(
  limit = 2000,
  filters = list(agency = "NYPD", city = "BROOKLYN")
)

head(filtered)
```

## About

`nycOpenData` makes New York City's civic datasets accessible to students,  
educators, analysts, and researchers through a unified and user-friendly R interface.  
Developed to support reproducible research, open-data literacy, and real-world analysis.

---

## Comparison to Other Software

While the [`RSocrata`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RSocrata) package provides a general interface for any Socrata-backed portal, `nycOpenData` is specifically tailored for the New York City ecosystem. 

- **Ease of Use**: No need to hunt for 4x4 dataset IDs (e.g., `erm2-nwe9`); functions like `nyc_311()` map directly to the most popular city datasets.
- **Pre-configured Logic**: Wrappers include default sorting (e.g., `created_date DESC`) and optimized limit handling specific to NYC’s massive data volumes.
- **Open Literacy**: Designed specifically for students and researchers to lower the barrier to entry for civic data analysis.
