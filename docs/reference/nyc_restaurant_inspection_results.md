## Value

A tibble containing DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results
data.

## Details

The dataset contains every sustained or not yet adjudicated violation
citation from every full or special program inspection conducted up to
three years prior to the most recent inspection for restaurants and
college cafeterias in an active status on the RECORD DATE (date of the
data pull). When an inspection results in more than one violation,
values for associated fields are repeated for each additional violation
record. Establishments are uniquely identified by their CAMIS (record
ID) number. Keep in mind that thousands of restaurants start business
and go out of business every year; only restaurants in an active status
are included in the dataset. Records are also included for each
restaurant that has applied for a permit but has not yet been inspected
and for inspections resulting in no violations. Establishments with
inspection date of 1/1/1900 are new establishments that have not yet
received an inspection. Restaurants that received no violations are
represented by a single row and coded as having no violations using the
ACTION field. Because this dataset is compiled from several large
administrative data systems, it contains some illogical values that
could be a result of data entry or transfer errors. Data may also be
missing. This dataset and the information on the Health Department’s
Restaurant Grading website come from the same data source. The Health
Department’s Restaurant Grading website is here:
http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/services/restaurant-grades.page See the
data dictionary file in the Attachments section of the OpenData website
for a summary of data fields and allowable values.
