Let’s put everything together get dataset last 50 311 requests New York Police Department Brooklyn. successfully created dataset contains 50 recent requests regarding NYPD borough Brooklyn.","code":"small_sample <- nyc_shooting_incidents(limit = 3) small_sample #> # A tibble: 3 × 22 #>   incident_key occur_date            occur_time boro  loc_of_occur_desc precinct #>   <chr>        <chr>                 <chr>      <chr> <chr>             <chr>    #> 1 313716449    2025-09-30T00:00:00.… 17:56:00   BRONX OUTSIDE           48       #> 2 313716449    2025-09-30T00:00:00.… 17:56:00   BRONX OUTSIDE           48       #> 3 313635117    2025-09-29T00:00:00.… 04:17:00   QUEE… OUTSIDE           102      #> # ℹ 16 more variables: jurisdiction_code <chr>, loc_classfctn_desc <chr>, #> #   location_desc <chr>, statistical_murder_flag <chr>, perp_age_group <chr>, #> #   perp_sex <chr>, perp_race <chr>, vic_age_group <chr>, vic_sex <chr>, #> #   vic_race <chr>, x_coord_cd <chr>, y_coord_cd <chr>, latitude <chr>, #> #   longitude <chr>, geocoded_column.type <chr>, #> #   geocoded_column.coordinates <list>  # Seeing what columns are in the dataset colnames(small_sample) #>  [1] \"incident_key\"                \"occur_date\"                  #>  [3] \"occur_time\"                  \"boro\"                        #>  [5] \"loc_of_occur_desc\"           \"precinct\"                    #>  [7] \"jurisdiction_code\"           \"loc_classfctn_desc\"          #>  [9] \"location_desc\"               \"statistical_murder_flag\"     #> [11] \"perp_age_group\"              \"perp_sex\"                    #> [13] \"perp_race\"                   \"vic_age_group\"               #> [15] \"vic_sex\"                     \"vic_race\"                    #> [17] \"x_coord_cd\"                  \"y_coord_cd\"                  #> [19] \"latitude\"                    \"longitude\"                   #> [21] \"geocoded_column.type\"        \"geocoded_column.coordinates\" brooklyn_311 <- nyc_311(limit = 3, filters = list(borough = \"BROOKLYN\")) brooklyn_311 #> # A tibble: 3 × 32 #>   unique_key created_date           agency agency_name complaint_type descriptor #>   <chr>      <chr>                  <chr>  <chr>       <chr>          <chr>      #> 1 67904910   2026-02-09T02:04:58.0… NYPD   New York C… Blocked Drive… No Access  #> 2 67903232   2026-02-09T02:03:09.0… NYPD   New York C… Noise - Resid… Loud Musi… #> 3 67903202   2026-02-09T02:01:06.0… NYPD   New York C… Illegal Parki… Blocked H… #> # ℹ 26 more variables: location_type <chr>, incident_zip <chr>, #> #   incident_address <chr>, street_name <chr>, cross_street_1 <chr>, #> #   cross_street_2 <chr>, intersection_street_1 <chr>, #> #   intersection_street_2 <chr>, address_type <chr>, city <chr>, #> #   landmark <chr>, status <chr>, community_board <chr>, #> #   council_district <chr>, police_precinct <chr>, bbl <chr>, borough <chr>, #> #   x_coordinate_state_plane <chr>, y_coordinate_state_plane <chr>, …  # Checking to see the filtering worked unique(brooklyn_311$borough) #> [1] \"BROOKLYN\" # Creating the dataset brooklyn_nypd <- nyc_311(limit = 50, filters = list(agency = \"NYPD\", borough = \"BROOKLYN\"))  # Calling head of our new dataset head(brooklyn_nypd) #> # A tibble: 6 × 36 #>   unique_key created_date           agency agency_name complaint_type descriptor #>   <chr>      <chr>                  <chr>  <chr>       <chr>          <chr>      #> 1 67904910   2026-02-09T02:04:58.0… NYPD   New York C… Blocked Drive… No Access  #> 2 67903232   2026-02-09T02:03:09.0… NYPD   New York C… Noise - Resid… Loud Musi… #> 3 67903202   2026-02-09T02:01:06.0… NYPD   New York C… Illegal Parki… Blocked H… #> 4 67899589   2026-02-09T01:59:15.0… NYPD   New York C… Blocked Drive… No Access  #> 5 67901438   2026-02-09T01:58:14.0… NYPD   New York C… Illegal Parki… Posted Pa… #> 6 67894104   2026-02-09T01:57:21.0… NYPD   New York C… Noise - Resid… Loud Musi… #> # ℹ 30 more variables: location_type <chr>, incident_zip <chr>, #> #   incident_address <chr>, street_name <chr>, cross_street_1 <chr>, #> #   cross_street_2 <chr>, intersection_street_1 <chr>, #> #   intersection_street_2 <chr>, address_type <chr>, city <chr>, #> #   landmark <chr>, status <chr>, community_board <chr>, #> #   council_district <chr>, police_precinct <chr>, bbl <chr>, borough <chr>, #> #   x_coordinate_state_plane <chr>, y_coordinate_state_plane <chr>, …  # Quick check to make sure our filtering worked nrow(brooklyn_nypd) #> [1] 50 unique(brooklyn_nypd$agency) #> [1] \"NYPD\" unique(brooklyn_nypd$borough) #> [1] \"BROOKLYN\""},{"path":"https://martinezc1.github.io/nycOpenData/articles/getting-started.html","id":"mini-analysis","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Mini analysis","title":"Getting Started with nycOpenData","text":"Now successfully pulled data R, let’s mini analysis using complaint_type column, figure NYC residents Brooklyn complaining NYPD. , create bar graph complaint types.
